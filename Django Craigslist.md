This repo demonstrates Craigslist clone/wrapper, created with Python and Django. Many Craigslist list pages don't display any images with the post, but this wrapper formats the page and ensures there is always an image displayed with the post. Requests is used to pull the data from Craigslist. The app should search your local Craigslist directory.
